# Ad_Tech_Challenge

The purpose of the following analysis is to demonstrate skills in data management, analytical ability, business strategy, and communications skills. This challenge was given to real life applicants in order to test these very skills for a role within the ad tech industry. I have chosen to do this challenge in order to demonstrate my own skills and develop my knowledge of ad tech. The full details of the challenge can be read in the file titled SBM 2017 Analytics Challenge.pdf.

# Preparing and processing

We were given real data that Chegg has received from its ad partners in a csv file. The file contains the following, DFP Impressions, Paid Impressions, DFP Revenue, and Ad Revenue. Each row contains these values for each respective ad partner along with the date the data was received and the website it was collected from. To begin the cleaning process the project dataset was copied to ensure a backup is available. Each column was then checked for consistent formatting. To begin this process filters were created to see if any inconsistencies existed in the date column. No blank cells existed however a few instances of “Total” existed. We find in these “total” rows the metrics for each month are summed. This is irrelevant and causes inconsistent formatting so these rows were removed. Next the site column was checked for inconsistencies by filtering. No instances of incorrect formatting or spelling was detected. The rest of the columns contain only numbers so filtering won't be ideal for checking consistent formatting. To check that each cell is a number we create a new sheet that references each column using an array function. The function then fills each corresponding cell it references with text stating “Valid Number” or “Not Number”. We then filter each of these columns to see if any instances of “Not Number” appear. We also double check the date column using the same technique. The date column returns “Valid date” or “Not a date”. This sheet can be found here. No instances of “Not Number” or “Not a date” appear. The last concern was many instances of zero or empty values in the number columns. This means no value was reported and is detailed in the project description. Too many instances of empty values appear to remove rows where they occur. The final sheet can be seen here. With the formatting checked, a pivot table is created that sums the values of all three sites on each corresponding date. The Pivot table can be seen here. The “Mth” column was not included due to its irrelevance. Snorlax Tagless was also excluded because every cell was empty besides 2 that had a value of 11 in the DFP revenue column. These cells were removed in the early stages of the cleaning process but can be seen in the backup sheet here.
    Finally the calculator was made in a new sheet. The calculator can be seen here. The date cell is referenced by every function and looks up data from the pivot table. Changing the date calculates the specific metrics for the seven days leading up to and including the date refenced. The weeks where many instances of no values were reported causes a bit of trouble for the calculator, for example #DIV/0!. However the dates required of the project work fine along with weeks that don't have any missing data.
